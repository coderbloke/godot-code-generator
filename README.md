# godot-code-generator

A lightweight Godot library for code generation from template (or just for any general text template processing)

You can generate output (e.g. script):
- From a source template file containing tags
- According to generator specification, where you describe the tags
- Using a context (any object), which provides to subtitution for the tags 

Driving force:
- Was needed for this: https://github.com/coderbloke/godot-inspector-architect<br>
  Code snippets coming from different places, they put together into a script, which then can be loaded and used dynamically on-the-fly
- It turned out to be a quite neat reusable, even int he early phase
  Can be help usefull for anyone
